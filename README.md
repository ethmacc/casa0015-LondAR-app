# SunChaser

This repository contains the code and associated project documentation for the SunChaser mobile application. SunChaser is a handy app that tells you where is the best spot in a city to get some sunshine. It utilizes sun positioning algorithms, combined with local weather data and an approximation of building heights to give users the best guess of where the suniest spots of the city are.

## Concept & Development

The initial concept was sketched out on paper as a simple storyboard:

The key features are as follows:
- A map API to show users their current location (location services must be enabled)
- A filter function to show:
  -  Approximate heights of buildings and highlight built-up areas
  -  


## Installation

Include a section that gives intructions on how to install the app or run it in Flutter.  What versions of the plugins are you assuming?  Maybe define a licence

##  Contact Details

Having Contact Details is also good as it shows people how to get in contact with you if they'd like to contribute to the app.
